            <h1>Taiwan</h1>
            <p>While visiting Taiwan, we explored several temples that highlighted the country's deep spiritual traditions. Many of these temples were dedicated to Buddhist or Taoist deities and were active places of worship. We observed locals burning incense, offering food, and praying quietly in front of intricately decorated altars. The temple structures featured ornate carvings, traditional Chinese rooflines with dragon and phoenix designs, and red lanterns hanging in rows. Some temples were bustling with activity, while others were calm and reflective. Visiting these spaces helped us understand how religion and daily life are closely connected in Taiwanese culture.</p>
