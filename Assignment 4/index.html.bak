			<h1><i class="fa-solid fa-chess"></i> CHESS <i class="fa-solid fa-chess-board"></i></h1>
			<p>Chess has always been one of my favorite games, especially when I was younger and played it more often. I did pretty well back then, enjoying the challenge of outthinking my opponent and planning ahead. Although I haven’t played in a while, I still find it incredibly engaging whenever I do. The problem-solving aspect, combined with the need for strategic foresight, makes every game feel like a mental workout. It is one of those games that never really leaves you. You might get a little rusty, but the thrill of anticipating your opponent’s next move and executing a well-planned strategy always makes it exciting.</p>
