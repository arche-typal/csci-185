            <h4>Q: Are all of these trips recent?</h4>
            <p>Some of these trips were taken at different points in my life. I've included them here to share a range of experiences, not necessarily as a travel log.</p>

            <h4>Q: Was this site created for a class?</h4>
            <p>Yes, this site was developed as part of a course project to demonstrate basic web development skills while exploring a topic of personal interest.</p>

            <h4>Q: Why these specific countries?</h4>
            <p>These are places where I either had meaningful experiences or learned something significant. I focused on them for this project to keep things manageable and focused.</p>
