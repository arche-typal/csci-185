            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm a student with a strong interest in cultural geography, history, and how people interact with the places they live. Travel has given me the chance to learn directly from local communities, observe environments I had only read about, and better understand global diversity. While I'm not a professional traveler, I approach each trip as a chance to listen, ask questions, and connect with people and places in a meaningful way.</p>
